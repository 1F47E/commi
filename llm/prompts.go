  <commit>
    <title>Brief title (50 characters or less)</title>
    <changes>
      <change>One change per line, word-wrapped to 70 characters if needed</change>
      <!-- More <change> elements as needed -->
    </changes>
    <summary>Summarize changes in 1 sentence</summary>
  </commit>

• Focus on the main changes and their purpose
• Return the commit message as valid XML
• Ensure the message is clear, informative, and fits the conventional format.
